# Brownies

This recipe makes an 8x8" pan of brownies with low effort. It dirties one pan in
which you make the batter, and uses an 8x8" baking pan that can remain clean if
you use parchment paper.

Use this recipe in place of box brownie mix: it produces higher quality for a
similar time and energy investment.

This recipe originates form on Adam Ragusea's Youtube channel with little
modification. See the [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhnzdRD-hX8)

of the video.

## Ingredients

-   1 stick butter
-   1/2 cup cocoa-powder
-   1 14 oz can Sweetened Condensed Milk
-   1 cup or 120&nbsp;g Powdered Sugar
-   2 teaspoons Vanilla extract
-   2 teaspoons Molasses, optionally
-   A pinch of salt
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   1 whole egg
-   1 cup or 120&nbsp;g all-purpose flour

## Method

1.  Get your oven heating to 325ºF, 160ºC, ideally convection. This batter
    sticks to pans, line your pan with parchment paper.
1.  Put the butter in a mid-sized pot and heat over medium until it melts and
    the water boils out. Stir the butter as it starts to brown, to keep the milk
    solids from sticking to the bottom. When the butter starts to brown and
    smell like caramel, whisk in the cocoa powder. Let the cocoa boil for a
    minute then take the pot off the heat.
1.  Whisk in the sweetened condensed milk, then the powdered sugar until it
    dissolves fully.
1.  Whisk in the salt, vanilla, molasses, egg and baking powder.
1.  Whisk in the flour.
1.  Get the batter in the pan. Don't worry about spreading it out evenly because
    it spreads out in the oven.
1.  Bake 30-40 min, until a toothpick to the center comes out almost clean.
1.  Let cool thoroughly before cutting, roughly 30 minutes.
